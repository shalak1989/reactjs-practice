Need to use build workflows/tools:

- Gives access to newer javascript features (es5 and es6)
- This will add CSS prefixes
- Linting 
- Dependency management - we will use going to use npm or yarn (NPM for this course)
- Bundler: we will use webpack, this will condense our files into a few files
- Compiler: Babel + presets (this is for jsx I believe?)
- Development server: will use a local web server
- We are going to use a react build tool (made by the official react team):

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

use: npm install -g create-react-app
